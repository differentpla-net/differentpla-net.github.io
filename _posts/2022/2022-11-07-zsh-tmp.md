Problems with zsh on macOS.

```
zsh: can't create temp file for here document: permission denied
```

The permissions on `/tmp`, which is a symlink to `/tmp/private` are kinda screwy on my macOS installation:

```
% ls -ld /tmp
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  11 24 Aug 09:59 /tmp@ -> private/tmp
% ls -ld /private/tmp
drwxr-xr-x  13 root  admin  416  7 Nov 19:58 /private/tmp/
```

Are they supposed to look like that? Dunno. I don't have another Mac to compare with. Various things on the Internet
suggest just shotgunning a `chmod 777` in there, but I'm not happy with that.

The _correct_ answer, as far as I can tell is this:

```sh
export TMPPREFIX="$TMPDIR"
```

Zsh uses `$TMPPREFIX` (which defaults to `/tmp/zsh`), but everything else uses `$TMPDIR` (which appears to be set
somewhat sanely).
