Because I'm running my k3s cluster on Raspberry Pi 4 nodes, and they're
[ARM-64 (aarch64)]({% post_url 2021/2021-12-20-raspi-ubuntu %}), I keep running into problems where applications
are compiled for x86_64 (amd64) and don't run.

For example, I had to [use community-built images for ArgoCD]({% post_url 2022/2022-02-02-argocd %}), and when you
attempt to run the ArgoCD guestbook example, you get the following error:

```
$ kubectl logs guestbook-ui-85985d774c-lbhnq
standard_init_linux.go:228: exec user process caused: exec format error
```

> This seems like a lot of work, Roger. Why don't you just add an x86_64 node to the cluster?

Yeah, I _could_ do that -- I've got a couple of NUCs in the house running Linux -- but, because of the
difference in size between a Raspberry Pi 4B and a Gen-10 Core i5 NUC with 32GiB RAM, all of my workload would end up
running on the NUCs, which doesn't exactly replicate a production environment.

One other issue I'm finding is that the deploy manifests aren't specifying the desired node architecture:

```yaml
...
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
...
```

If they'd done that, instead of the `exec format error`, the scheduler would have left the pod in `Pending`, because it
wouldn't be able to find a suitable node for it.

Honestly, though, I'd probably be just as bad at forgetting to specify that...
