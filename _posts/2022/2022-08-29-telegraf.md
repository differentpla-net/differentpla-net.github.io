One of my NUCs keeps hanging, and I suspect temperature. I wanted to use collectd to gather the temperature sensor
values, but it was removed from Ubuntu 22.04. Instead, I'm going to see if I can get telegraf to do it instead.

## Background

I have a NUC in the living room, running Emby Server. It keeps dying. The Emby client can't connect; I can't SSH to it;
I can't ping it; attempting to wake it up with the keyboard does nothing.

I suspect that it might be a temperature problem, and I have monit set up to keep an eye on that, but monit only alerts
at given thresholds; it doesn't report ongoing values.

So I wanted to install `collectd` and have it record the temperature every few minutes or so. Rather than report to
graphite/grafana (because my k3s cluster is turned off right now), I planned to have it write to local RRD files, and
I'd collate them later.

Unfortunately, I upgraded the NUC to Ubuntu 22.04 yesterday, and collectd is no longer in the default repository. So I'm
going to play with `telegraf` instead.

It's part of the _InfluxDB_ family, but I'm going to see if I can get away without installing InfluxDB just yet
(because, again, my k3s cluster is turned off).

## Installation

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install telegraf
```

Edit the configuration file at `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.config`. To enable the `sensors` plugin, uncomment the
`[[inputs.sensors]]` section. The defaults are probably fine. Similarly, uncomment the `[[outputs.file]]` section.

## Test the configuration

```
$ telegraf --config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.config --input-filter sensors --test

```

## Restart the daemon

```bash
sudo service telegraf restart
```

Is it working?

```
$ tail -f /tmp/metrics.out
processes,host=roger-nuc total_threads=502i,idle=68i,zombies=2i,running=0i,unknown=0i,dead=0i,paging=0i,blocked=0i,stopped=0i,sleeping=160i,total=230i 1661787590000000000
sensors,chip=coretemp-isa-0000,feature=package_id_0,host=roger-nuc temp_max=100,temp_crit=100,temp_crit_alarm=0,temp_input=39 1661787590000000000
```

## Now we wait

Now we wait. The next time the NUC freezes, I should be able to restart it and then take a look at the
`/tmp/metrics.out` output file to see if there's anything obviously wrong.

## Follow-up

Like a complete idiot, I forgot that `/tmp` would be wiped on restart, so there was nothing useful in the output file.

On the other hand, it was spamming `/var/log/syslog`, so there was a record of the metrics in there. It's _not_ a
temperature thing.

To turn off the syslog spam (which is due to stdout -> systemd -> syslog), and to fix the /tmp thing, edit
`/etc/telegraf/telegraf.con` (as root):

```toml
[[outputs.file]]
  ## Files to write to, "stdout" is a specially handled file.
  files = ["/var/log/telegraf/metrics.out"]
```

That is: remove `stdout`; write to somewhere more persistent. You _might_ need to create the directory first (I didn't).
If you do, it's:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/log/telegraf/
sudo chown _telegraf:_telegraf /var/log/telegraf/
sudo chmod 755 /var/log/telegraf/
```

Don't forget to restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo service telegraf restart
```
