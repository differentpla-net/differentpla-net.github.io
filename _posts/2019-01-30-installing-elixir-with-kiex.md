At Electric Imp, we manage our Elixir versions with kiex.

Assuming you have `kiex` available in your path, installing a version of Elixir
is simple:

    kiex install 1.8.1

This installs to `~/.kiex/elixirs`, and can be activated with the following:

    source $HOME/.kiex/elixirs/elixir-1.8.1.env

...or you could use `direnv`...
