I'm moving to a new blog, using a blog engine I'm writing myself. Head over to [blog.differentpla.net](http://blog.differentpla.net/) to check it out.

For the time-being, I'll keep this old blog running, but I'll be migrating the content over fairly soon, at which point this site will just redirect to that one.
