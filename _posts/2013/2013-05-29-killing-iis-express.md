title: Killing IIS Express

A brief aside: I've got to the point where I'm about to fire up IIS Express from
Visual Studio. In order to be a good citizen, our extension should probably shut
it down again later.

So, let's fire up JetBrains dotPeek and see how the IIS Express tray application
does it.

The obvious place to start looking is in `IisExpressWorkerProcess.Stop`. This
calls `IisExpressHelper.SendStopMessageToProcess`, passing a process ID.

This searches using `GetTopWindow` and `GetWindow(GW_NEXT)` for top-level windows
belonging to the correct process. It then posts a `WM_QUIT` message to it. I'll
add some code for that later.

Why not use Process.CloseMainWindow?

`Process.CloseMainWindow()` posts a `WM_CLOSE` message, rather than `WM_QUIT`.
But, mainly, it doesn't work with IIS Express, because `MainWindowHandle` is zero.
