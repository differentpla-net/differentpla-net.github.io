If you don't know what [electric imp](http://electricimp.com) is, what an
[April Development
Board](http://electricimp.com/docs/hardware/resources/reference-designs/april/)
is, and you don't have a [Dymo LetraTag
LT-100H](http://global.dymo.com/enGB/Products/LetraTag_LT-100H.html) label
printer, then this isn't going to be of much use to you.

If you do know what all of those things are, and you have more than one April board,
and you have more than one imp module, and you have a need to keep track of which
one is which (basically, you're me), then this'll come in quite handy.

## April board

For printing the device id on the April board, you'll need to:

1. Set the label printer to "Small"
2. Enter the 16-digit number on two lines ("Insert" button, down, "Second Line")

## imp module

For printing the MAC address on the imp module, you'll need to:

1. Set the label printer to "Extra Small"
2. Enter the 12-digit number in 6 pairs.
