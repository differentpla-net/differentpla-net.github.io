title: Failed to enumerate SSL bindings

In PowerShell, when I attempted to enumerate SSL bindings, I was getting the
error message:

    Failed to enumerate SSL bindings, error code 234.

This is sometimes due to misconfiguration of the SSL certificate bindings in
the registry, under
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\HTTP\Parameters\SslBindingInfo`.
This controls the SSL certificate bindings; either all of the entries in here
must have a value named `SslCertStoreName`, or none of them must.

One of my colleagues found this answer on [this MSDN forum](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/87b1252d-a6a0-4251-bbb6-38e104a8c07a/enumerating-iissslbindings-gives-failure-on-one-machine-works-on-another?forum=winserverpowershell#0425cd3a-0da0-45df-960f-a614bf30aae1), but that's kinda hard to read.

With PowerShell:
--

    # Find those entries which are missing the 'SslCertStoreName' property:    
    # Note, that, for some reason, this includes the `[::1]:443` entry, even if it's not broken,
    # which means that we can't easily script the fix.
    $brokenBindings = dir HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\HTTP\Parameters\SslBindingInfo | 
            where { !(Get-ItemProperty -Path $_.PSPath -Name SslCertStoreName) }

    # Output the certificate thumbprint for the broken ones:
    $brokenBindings | % {
                    $hashBytes = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $_.PSPath -Name SslCertHash).SslCertHash
                    $hashString = [BitConverter]::ToString($hashBytes).Replace('-', '')
                    Write-Output ("{0} -- {1}" -f $_.Name, $hashString)
    }
