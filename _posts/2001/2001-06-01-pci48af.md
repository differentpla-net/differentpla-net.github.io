A while back, I was trying to get a computer built out of some spare parts to run Linux in the corner of the office.
However, I had some trouble with random lockups. I think it had something to do with the memory configuration of the
motherboard.

Unfortunately, the company that make the motherboard, TMC, don't support any of their pre-Pentium motherboards. This
one's a 486 board, running an AMD5x86. Fortunately, I posted a request for information on "Trish's Escape From Hardware
Hell Messageboard", and got a response from a guy called Carl Smith, who happened to have a copy of the manual for the
board, which is a TMC PCI48AF (revision 3.00).

I've reproduced Carl's scans from the manual here.

<p>You can find the drivers (Win95, NT3.5, DOS, OS/2, Novell and SCO)
for the ALI chipset for this board <A

Unfortunately, I don't have any other information about the board - I gave up on getting it to work with more than 32Mb
in it, and it got lost when I moved from London to Cambridge.  However, because this information still generates a
couple of emails a year, I decided to leave it here.
