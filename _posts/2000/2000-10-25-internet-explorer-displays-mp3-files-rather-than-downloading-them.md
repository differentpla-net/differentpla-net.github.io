This one's very rare. I don't anticipate it ever happening to anyone
else. It did, however, happen to me, so I thought I'd share it.

Normally, clicking on an MP3 file causes Internet Explorer to display a
dialog box, asking whether you want to save the file, or open it
directly. In this case, it wasn't working. The file was just getting
displayed in the browser window.

Some snooping around in the relevant parts of the registry identified
the problem. There was a little bit of a snafu in my MIME type database.

To briefly explain, the HTTP response (see RFC 2616 for details)
contains a "Content-Type" header, which describes the MIME type of the
data being sent.

This header is used to locate the "helper application" (to use Netscape
parlance) responsible for rendering the content. In Windows, this
information is stored in the "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content
Type" registry key.

I've not found out what all of the settings in here do yet, but it was
this portion of my registry that had the snafu. There was a missing
CLSID entry in the "audio/mpeg" key. I copied the one from the
"audio/midi" key, and was back in business.
