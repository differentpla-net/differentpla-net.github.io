I have a few timelapse Lego build videos on my YouTube channel. This post explains how that's set up. It's mostly to
remind myself for next time.

## Camera

For the earlier videos, I used a GoPro Hero Session, which does a great job, but -- annoyingly -- can only be controlled
from a tablet or phone connected to the Wifi access point on the camera. It doesn't have a touch screen, and the
controls on the camera itself are kinda rudimentary. It's tiny, though, and it works really well when attached to my
snowboarding helmet.

I've just bought a GoPro Hero 12, so we'll see how that goes.

## Camera Mount

For the first few videos, I used a step ladder with an old bench vice attached to the top. That held a broomstick, and
the camera was attached to that using the tube attachment thing that came with the kit. Presumably it's intended for
bicycle handlebars or something.

I replaced the whole step ladder and bench vice arrangement with a new bench vice that has a ball joint and can be
positioned at various angles. That can be clamped to the edge of the work table. The broomstick is replaced with an
extendable paint roller handle (minus the paint roller), which takes up less space when packed away.

Since all of the GoPro mounts are compatible with each other, I can use the old mount with the new camera.

## Timelapse Recording

The camera is set to take photos with 2s intervals. The Hero 12 has a mode that makes a timelapse video directly, but
I'm not sure if I trust that yet.

## Camera App

The reason I got the Hero 12 is because the Hero Session is only really controllable with an app. Ironically, when the
camera is mounted as shown, it's basically impossible to control with the touchscreen anyway. So I guess I need the app.

The GoPro app, Quik, seems OK. Pairing the app with the camera uses Bluetooth, and just worked. It still uses a
temporary Wifi network for previewing the camera, but that's now controlled from the app, rather than from the camera,
which makes things easier.

It asked me about whether I wanted to sign in, or subscribe or whatever -- I don't -- but it seems to work fine in
"guest" mode. I wonder if that'll get enshittified at some point, but for now it's fine.
