**2022-09-11:** This blog continues to be hosted on GitHub Pages; this page is of historical interest only. If that.

I've installed [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org) at
[discourse.differentpla.net](http://discourse.differentpla.net) as a way of
enabling comments on this blog.

I've enabled Google, Twitter and Github login, so it should be relatively
frictionless to post comments and/or criticism of my blog posts.

The actual installation of Discourse was relatively simple, so I don't think
I'll bother writing that up.

Oh, apart from [configuring DNS for
Mailgun](http://blog.differentpla.net/blog/2015/02/22/mailgun-enom/). I wrote
that up.

#### Update: 20 Apr 2019

I uninstalled Discourse; I'm at peace with not allowing comments.
