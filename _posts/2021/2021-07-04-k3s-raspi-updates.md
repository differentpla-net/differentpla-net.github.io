About 2 years ago, I spent some time messing around with k3s on a cluster made
from 5x _Raspberry Pi 2 Model B_ nodes.

I'm rebuilding it with 5x _Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB)_ nodes.

I'm using 64GB USB flash drives, instead of SD cards. Other than that, not a lot has changed.

I _have_ colour-coordinated the heatsinks with the network cables, so there's that, I guess.
