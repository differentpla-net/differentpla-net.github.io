I was bored this afternoon, so I thought I'd see how hard it would be to write an emplode clone in C#.

The first thing to do is to write some code that talks to the empeg. It turns out that the empeg's TCP/IP protocol isn't that simple.

I'll probably get bored and move onto something else before I finish, but -- until then -- the [empeg Protocol topic](/content/topics/empeg/empeg-protocol) will document my meanderings through the empeg protocol.
