When you add a new gadget to the sidebar (by right-clicking and selecting "Add Gadgets..."), Windows Vista displays an icon for it.

[img_assist|nid=166|title=|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=640|height=281]

This icon is controlled by your Gadget.xml file:

<pre><gadget>
  <icons>
    <icon height="48" width="48" src="GadgetIcon.png" />
  </icons>
</gadget></pre>

The icon should be 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels hide. You'll normally use a .PNG file. As you can see from the above screenshot, I took the normal icon and recoloured it (in [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/)) slightly to demonstrate.
