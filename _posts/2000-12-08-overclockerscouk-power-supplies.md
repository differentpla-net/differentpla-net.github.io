I don't know if there's something in particular about Overclockers.co.uk, but we've not had any good experiences with their power supplies. We've had two power supplies from ocuk, and they've both gone horribly wrong, and fried a whole shedload of hardware.

So far, the tally (two computers) comes to something like:

*   52Gb of IDE hard disks.
*   9Gb of SCSI hard disk.
*   A DAT drive.
*   A 40x Plextor SCSI CD-ROM drive.
*   A 4x Plextor SCSI CD-ROM drive.
*   A Soundblaster Live!
*   An Asus P2B-LS motherboard.
*   An Intel Pentium II-400
*   An Intel Pentium II-350

The odd thing is that the two PSUs are from different manufacturers, so there's no pattern there. Regardless, we're not going to be using OCUK again.
