In attempting to see if I could get my [NBehave tests](https://www.differentpla.net/content/2010/05/nbehave-notes) working inside Visual Studio 2010, I stumbled across [Gallio](http://www.gallio.org/), which, as far as I can tell, claims support for ReSharper and NBehave.

It turns out that the 3.1 builds listed on the [downloads](http://www.gallio.org/Downloads.aspx) page aren’t new enough. They only support ReSharper 4.5\. For [ReSharper 5.x support](http://groups.google.com/group/gallio-dev/browse_thread/thread/7fd947efe4a8849e), you’ll need to grab a v3.2 build from the [development builds](http://ccnet.gallio.org/Distributables/) page. At the time of writing, Gallio v3.2 build 437 was the latest available.

That said, I’ve still not managed to completely get my head around NBehave. More on that later.
