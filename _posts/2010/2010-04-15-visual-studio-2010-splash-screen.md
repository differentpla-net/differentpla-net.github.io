The [Visual Studio 2010 splash screen](http://blogs.msdn.com/visualstudio/archive/2009/11/11/behind-the-scenes-splash-screen.aspx) is stored in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\vs000223.dat`. It's a hidden file. It's a PNG file.

It's generated by the installer; if you remove it and run Visual Studio, you'll get a default splash screen, without the registered owner information. You can recreate it by following the instructions [here](http://t800t8.blogspot.com/2010/04/how-to-change-registered-owner-and.html).

The registered owner information is in 8pt Segoe UI

**Note to self:** Immediately after installing Windows 7, double-check the registered owner information _before_ installing anything else. The Windows registered owner information is in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion`, in the `RegisteredOwner` and `RegisteredOrganization` values. It's also in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion`, and the two keys don't appear to be mirrored, unlike HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.
