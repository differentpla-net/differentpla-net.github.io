New theme: [Acquia Slate](http://fusiondrupalthemes.com/theme/acquia-slate). It's maybe a little dark for my taste, but I'm going to leave it for a couple of weeks and see if it grows on me.

**Updated:** It didn't. For one thing, the background colour is all wrong in the edit preview page. I've gone to [Acquia Marina](http://fusiondrupalthemes.com/theme/acquia-marina) instead.
