## Background

I'm taking a few days to play with Kubernetes. Since I have a stack of Raspberry Pi 2s otherwise doing nothing, I decided to use them. I started with Scott Hanselman's [How to Build a Kubernetes Cluster with ARM Raspberry Pi then run .NET Core on OpenFaas](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToBuildAKubernetesClusterWithARMRaspberryPiThenRunNETCoreOnOpenFaas.aspx) blog post.

I'm not going to bother with the .NET Core / OpenFaas stuff yet, but here's how I got on.
