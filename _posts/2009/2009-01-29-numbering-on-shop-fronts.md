When I'm supreme ruler of the universe: shops will be required to place the "house" number somewhere on the front of the shop. It should be easily visible.

This means that, when you get an address like 134 Tottenham Court Road, and you come out of a tube station with no idea of how far along the road (number-wise) you are, you'll be able to work out whether to turn left or right.
