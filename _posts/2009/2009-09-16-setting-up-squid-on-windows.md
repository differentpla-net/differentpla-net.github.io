At work, we do a lot of our testing and debugging with virtual machines (using Microsoft Virtual Server or Hyper-V,
mostly). The virtual guests are generally not allowed any access to our live network, which makes accessing the Internet
difficult. To get around this, I usually set up Squid on the host machine. This allows the guests to access (e.g.)
Windows Update and Microsoft Symbol Server, which makes things a bit easier.

Here's my quick guide to setting up Squid on Windows.

1.  Download the latest stable version of Squid from [http://squid.acmeconsulting.it/download/dl-squid.html](http://squid.acmeconsulting.it/download/dl-squid.html). At the time of writing this is [Squid 2.7-stable6](http://squid.acmeconsulting.it/download/squid-2.7.STABLE6-bin.zip).
2.  Unzip it to `C:\`. You should end up with a directory called `C:\squid`.
3.  In the `C:\squid\etc` directory, rename the configuration files as follows:
    *   mime.conf.default to mime.conf
    *   squid.conf.default to squid.conf
4.  If you want to put the cache and log directories on another drive -- they get quite large, edit the squid.conf file (see below).
5.  Run c:\squid\bin\squid -i to install it as a Windows service. You'll need to be elevated at this point.
6.  Run c:\squid\bin\squid -z to initialize the cache directories.
7.  Open up your firewall to either allow squid.exe or port 3128
8.  Start the squid service

## Using a different drive for the cache and log directories
