Publish to Digital Photo Frame is a plug-in for Windows Live Photo Gallery that makes it easy to upload your photos to a digital photo frame.

Have you got a digital photo frame? Does it use SD cards? Compact Flash? A USB stick? If it doesn't stream photos and movies from your home server, you probably get frustrated loading fresh content onto it.

I did, so I wrote this plug-in for Windows Live Photo Gallery that makes it easy to resize your photos and copy them to the media used for your digital photo frame.

It's got a [project page on CodePlex](http://publishtophotoframe.codeplex.com/). Note that CodePlex doesn't offer licenses as simple as [mine]({% post_url 2007/2007-08-06-source-code-license %}), so it's under the Apache license.
