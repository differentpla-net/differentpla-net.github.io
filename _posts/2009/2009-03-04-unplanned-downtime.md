At the end of February, differentpla.net suffered filesystem corruption. I had to revert pretty much everything to a previous backup, which meant losing about a week's worth of stuff.

Fortunately, updates are fairly sporadic (I'm lazy), so not much was lost.

Unfortunately, some files need to be restored from a remote backup, which I've not finished doing yet. This means that some things (avatars, attachments, etc.) might still be missing. I plan to have this fixed fairly soon.

It also took out the Gallery2 installation on both differentpla.net and do-or-die.com. As soon as I figure out what's broken, I'll fix it.
