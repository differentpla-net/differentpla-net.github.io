Quick tip: How to escape HTML text so that it can be quoted in another piece of HTML, e.g. in a `<pre>` tag.

```bash
cat index.html | \
    sed 's/&/\&amp;/' | \
    sed 's/"/\&quot;/' | \
    sed 's/</\&lt;/' | \
    sed 's/>/\&gt;/'
```

There's probably a simpler way to do this, but it works for me, so I'm putting it here before I forget.
