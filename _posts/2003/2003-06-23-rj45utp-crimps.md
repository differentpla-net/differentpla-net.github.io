(Seen from the bottom of the connector, so that the tab is facing away from you, and the gold pins are facing towards you) Pin 1 is on the left. Pin 8 is on the right.

If you're making a normal (straight-through) cable, pick either 586A or 586B and make sure that both ends are the same. I usually pick 586B.

If you're making a cross-over cable, one end should be 586A and the other end should be 586B.
