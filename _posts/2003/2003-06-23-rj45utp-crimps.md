(Seen from the bottom of the connector, so that the tab is facing away from you, and the gold pins are facing towards you) Pin 1 is on the left. Pin 8 is on the right.

If you're making a normal (straight-through) cable, pick either 568A or 568B and make sure that both ends are the same.
I usually pick 568B.

If you're making a cross-over cable, one end should be 568A and the other end should be 568B. Many network devices today
support auto-crossover.
