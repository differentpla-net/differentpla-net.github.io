The Visual Studio 2010 [splash screen](http://blogs.msdn.com/visualstudio/archive/2009/11/11/behind-the-scenes-splash-screen.aspx)
is stored in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\vs000223.dat`. It's a hidden file in PNG format.

The splash screen for Visual Studio 2012 is in `...\11.0\vs000223.dat`.

It's generated by the installer; to recreate it:

1. Fix the registered owner information for Windows (see below).
2. Delete the `vs000223.dat` file.
3. Run Visual Studio. The first time you do this, the splash screen will have no user information.
4. Run Visual Studio again. This time your updated user information will be shown.

Windows Registered Owner Information
--

Note to self: Immediately after installing Windows 8, double-check the registered
owner information before installing anything else. The Windows registered owner
information is in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion`,
in the `RegisteredOwner` and `RegisteredOrganization` values.

It's also in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion`,
and the two keys don't appear to be mirrored, unlike `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`.
