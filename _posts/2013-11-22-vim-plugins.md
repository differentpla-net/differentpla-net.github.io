This, for no particular reason, is the list of vim plugins that I'm currently using:

## Pathogen

How else are you going to manage this many plugins?

* [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

Well, yeah, you could use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

## Parentheses

* [delimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate) -- auto-completion for quotes, parens, etc.
* [rainbow_parentheses](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim) -- essential if you're doing any Clojure, but pretty useful anyway.

## Navigation

* [vim-unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) -- various things attached to the `[` and `]` keys. I mostly use `[b` and `]b` for jumping between buffers.
* [vim-signature](https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature) -- toggle, display and navigate marks.

## Programming stuff

* [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) -- Syntax checking inside vim.
* [vim-makeshift](https://github.com/johnsyweb/vim-makeshift) -- use the right 'makeprg'.
* [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) -- git stuff; I don't actually use it that much.
* [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) -- display changed lines in the gutter.

## Language Support

* squirrel -- some syntax rules for [Squirrel](http://www.squirrel-lang.org/)
* vim-django
* vim-elixir
* vim-jade
* vim-javascript
* vim-jsbeautify
* vim-scala
* vim-scons
