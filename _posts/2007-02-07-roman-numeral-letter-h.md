Someone appears to have spent some time searching my site for the term "Roman Numeral letter H". This is pointless, for two reasons:

1.  Until this post, I didn't have any content containing these terms, for the simple reason that...
2.  ...there is no H in the set of Roman numerals.

Valid Roman numerals are I, V, X, L, C, D, M. Numbers above 5000 use a bar over the letter. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) for more details.

This site _does_ contain an example of how to do Test-First- (or Test-Driven-) Design to create a Roman numeral converter. See [this page](/content/2004/01/test-first-roman-numeral-conversion).
