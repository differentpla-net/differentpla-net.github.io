By default, Outlook stores a copy of your outgoing email in the "Sent Items" folder in your local "Personal Folders" `.pst` file.

Sometimes you'd prefer that it stored them in a folder on the server.

There's no simple way to do this, so what you have to do is create a rule that processes your outgoing email and makes a copy of it.

See [this Microsoft Knowledgebase article](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q198854) for information on achieving this with Outlook 2000\. The procedure with Outlook XP is similar.

Unfortunately, it appears that messages placed in "Sent Items" are marked as new, which is a little confusing. I don't know of a workaround for this.
