When [moving](/content/2006/10/differentpla-net-is-moving) differentpla.net
from one server to another, I decided to move the content (currently served
using drupal) from the root to `/content`. I also decided to use more descriptive
URLs.

But I didn't want to break too many external links.

Here's how I used Apache's mod_rewrite - specifically RewriteMap - to achieve
this.

As explained in the linked page, I've moved differentpla.net from my Linux box
at home to a Virtual Private Server (VPS), hosted in the US.

I'll also be moving a few other websites from this machine. In order to better
implement a shared installation of both Gallery2 and drupal across those
websites, I decided to move differentpla.net's content from the root to a
subdirectory.

Along with this, I decided to make use of drupal's path remapping support to
generate more descriptive URLs for the content.

However, I don't particularly want to break external links to the website, so I
looked into using mod_rewrite to help with this.

It turns out that mod_rewrite has a feature called RewriteMap, which does
exactly what I want.

To use it, I simply added the following section to
`/etc/apache2/sites-available/differentpla.net`:

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine on

        RewriteLog /var/log/apache2/rewrite.log
        RewriteLogLevel 0

        # Anything matching /node/X or /node/view/X is remapped
        # via this text file, which is keyed on X
        RewriteMap txtmap txt:/home/www/sites/differentpla.net/map.txt

        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}      ^/node/view/
        RewriteRule ^/node/view/(.*)    /content/${txtmap:$1} [R]

        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}      ^/node/
        RewriteRule ^/node/(.*)         /content/${txtmap:$1} [R]
    </IfModule>

It's enclosed in a condition block, so that it only takes effect if mod_rewrite is enabled.

The first line turns on mod_rewrite. The next two control logging. Level 0 (zero) means that rewrite logging is off.

Then I define the RewriteMap. Currently this is a simple text file. mod_rewrite also has support for [other types of data source](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritemap).

Then there are the two things I want to recognise. There are two different ways to access drupal content. You can go to /node/NNN or /node/view/NNN. These two rules extract the NNN, look it up in the map, prefix it with /content/, and then issue a redirect.

Everything else is passed through unchanged.

Here's a snippet from map.txt:

    1       welcome
    10      2002/03/rsync-empegs

So, you can see that /node/1 or /node/view/1 are mapped to /content/welcome;
and that /node/10 and /node/view/10 are mapped to
/content/2002/03/rsync-empegs.
