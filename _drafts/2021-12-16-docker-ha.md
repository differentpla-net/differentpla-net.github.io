- Docker: HA. It can be done by using a storage driver, e.g. S3, which means
  that all replicas are using the same data.
  - To do that, we'd need a local S3 server. Which would need to be made HA as
    well.
  - HA with a single replica's fine, as long as the MTTR is low enough (does it
    start a replacement quickly?).
