# meck

- What is mocking?
  - Get pedantic about the terminology?
- Using meck to replace a function. meck:expect
- expect vs. called vs. history vs capture also wait. some examples in kafire
- "New" syntax
- ability to do sequences, loops, etc.
  - exec, seq, val, and how they're mostly implicit.
- stub_all, etc.
- passthrough vs. passthrough.
- strict
- ability to create a new module on the fly.
  - compare with other options?
- sticky
- Why not to do mocking?
  - If you can't inject alternative dependencies, maybe your design needs work.
- weirdness in coverage.
- NIFs?
  - probably not
- show an example from comcom, maybe talk about how else it could be done.
