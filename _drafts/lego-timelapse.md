I do occasional Lego timelapse videos (LINK). Becauuse I do them so rarely, I always forget how I did the last one.

Hardware:
- GoPro whatever it's called.
- LED lights.
- Bendy things.
- Power:
  - USB 5-way.
- Samsung Tab A2?
  - GoPro software. Wifi network.
- SDXC cards.
  - Sian recording was ~60GiB.
- Used to use a ladder with an extendible B&Q pole (for paint rollers), with a bench vise/vice.

- Now I'm using a multi-angle bench vise.
- Don't forget the cut-up insole for protecting the table surface.
- Cable ties, strain relief.
- Use of F-clamp to hold the power supply. Prefer hand-clamp/grip, but don't have one right now.
- Extension cord.
- Lengths of cables.

Recording:
- Which buttons to press on the GoPro, and on the tablet, since the UI is utterly terrible.

On the GoPro:
- Menu, to turn on. Remote control app.
- Tablet software PITA.

Encoding:
- It's in the Saturn V directory on ds416.
- Where do I run the encoding? It's ffmpeg, so I probably did it on my Core i7 Linux box, which is currently decommissioned.

Future options:
- Can I record directly from a decent webcam (or other camera), to avoid the SD card shenanigans? And the GoPro private Wifi network? And the random-ass tablet?
- Extra lights? Other angles?
