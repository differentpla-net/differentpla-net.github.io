## On testing

> The purpose of testing isn’t to be sure code is 100% correct. If it was, we’d use formal methods instead. Rather,
> testing is to get sufficient confidence that the code is sufficiently correct. We want to do this as painlessly as
> possible, which is why we want tests that are easy to write and give a lot of confidence, and also aren’t brittle or
> flaky.
