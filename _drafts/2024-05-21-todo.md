Things to write about:

- gen_statem:call and how you don't need to reply immediately.
- active mode TCP, and how that might play with the above.
- {packet, N} mode, and how it's super-useful for some protocols -- talk about memory use, maybe do some profiling?
- break down Ferd's binary buffering thing -- I didn't find his particularly readable.
- send_request/check_response.
- erlang:error and error_info -- the docs are pretty shonky.
- verifying that your callback implements the behaviour.
- erlang application startup, including `-s` in particular.
