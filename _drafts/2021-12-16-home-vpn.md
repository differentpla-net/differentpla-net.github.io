- Synology VPN server.
  - Gonna be at Mum's over Christmas. Might as well do this properly.
  - Didn't allow firewall access yet.
  - Nope.
    - Matrix of what-supports-what has no apparent overlaps.
    - OpenVPN UX is garbage.
    - Look into Wireguard, but it requires the VPN server be other than Synology. Unless I use Tailscale...?
    - Can you run Wireguard in a k8s container?
