- Motivation
  - Blame-free.
- Incident response/management out of scope, probably.
- Compensation
  - None.
    - Problem when you want to get someone on rotation who previously wasn't.
  - Bonus for being in the rotation.
  - Extra when on call.
  - Extra when paged.
  - Note about perverse incentives here.
- Rotation
  - Avoiding someone getting every Friday, e.g.
  - Daily/weekly?
    - If weekly, what to do when on call during office hours.
    - Follow up/work on incident tickets.
    - Improve monitoring, etc.
  - Follow-the-sun
    - Great for customer service, less so for on call. Handover lacking.
  - 24/7 for one week: burn out
    - Rotate to next person if paged.
    - Andrew and I did this when there were only the two of us (Rich was on vacation).
- Getting cover.
  - Vacation and, e.g., afk, and e.g. concert/cinema are different scenarios.
  - People problem, not process problem...?
- Responsibilities if paged:
  - Acknowledge.
  - Triage
  - File JIRA ticket/s.
  - Make sure that the responsible team follows up on those tickets. If you're doing the "work on improvements while on
    call in office hours", that might be you anyway.
- Escalation
  - Primary/secondary
  - Primary/manager
  - If you're always escalating to the same person (even unofficially) then that person is on call 24/7/365. Burnout.
  - Burnout anyway.
